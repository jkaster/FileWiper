# FileWiper
FileWiper utility written in Delphi

This is a little utility I put together that does what an old Norton Utility called DiskWipe or something like that used to do -- it will wipe a file, replacing all of its contents with zeros.

It also supports creating a new file if you want to wipe formerly deleted space from the drive.

It's a simple example that shows some of the file functions in Delphi, using the TFileStream component for file streaming, the Open file dialog, and action lists.

Use it at your own risk. I will not assume any responsibility for wiped drives or files.
